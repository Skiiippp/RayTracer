# RayTracer
A simple ray tracer, initially based on [this](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) tutorial. The runner script should work on debian based systems.<br/><br/>
Interesting features:
- Multithreading
- 3D mesh support using a custom .obj file interpreter. Example:
